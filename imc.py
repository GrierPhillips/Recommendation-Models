Implementation of Inductive Matric Completion.

Inductive Matrix Completion (IMC) is an algorithm for recommender systems with
side-information of users and items. The IMC formulation incorporates features
associated with rows (users) and columns (items) in matrix completion, so that
it enables predictions for users or items that were not seen during training,
and for which only features are known but no dyadic information (such as
ratings or linkages).
